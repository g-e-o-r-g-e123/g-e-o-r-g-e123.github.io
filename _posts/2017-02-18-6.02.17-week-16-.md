**-The Big If-****			**

**Target****~To Reach Approximately 25%~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective**

**_In this lesson I learnt by trial and improvement on one specific task called the Big If. I decided to not ask Mr Kean or my friends for too much help because it helps my learning by working things out for myself and I also had many ideas in which I could change things around and could swap bits of code around. _**

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

**_This didn't work because my ideas werenâ€™t right. Eventually I had to ask for help and I understood what they said and learnt from my mistakes. I need to work on my ability to recognise the bad bits in my coding so I could edit them out and get the coding right._**

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time I will ask for help earlier so that I don't spend too much time trying to figure it out myself and still getting it wrong.*
