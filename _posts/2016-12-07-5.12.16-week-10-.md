**-A WORKING ROBOT ARM AT LAST-****			**

**Target****~To work the robot arm and record it~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*Some friends helped me and Ben, so I proved what I said last week wrong: a bit of help or guidance from others can make a big difference as the robot arm now works.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*I think there may have been errors in the code which we did not spot, I need to work on 'filtering out' errors in my code with help from the software.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time, when something is not working, I will look very hard at the line of code which FUZE says is wrong and surrounding lines to spot errors. This will speed up the learning process. Also we should probably get better at typing.*
