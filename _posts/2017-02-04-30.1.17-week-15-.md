**-Boolean Operators-****			**

**Target****~Starting to Understand How to Use Boolean Operators~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*I learnt how to use Boolean operators by going through lots of the lessons on Codecademy. They help to determine whether something is true or false. *

*When I was stuck I asked my partner for help and when he was stuck he asked me. *

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*The website actually stopped working for me! It had an error message and told me to refresh the page, which I did a few times and it didn't work. After that I tried it on a different computer, this worked and I got to continue.*

*I should work on my problem solving skills because I probably should have tried a different computer earlier and not used so much of my time refreshing the page and closing chrome.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time I will try to search into more depth on the internet to find out about the topic I am doing. So when I am doing strings I could search up different ways to use strings or create strings. *
