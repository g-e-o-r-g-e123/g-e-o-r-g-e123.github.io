In today's lesson we did run-length encoding. This is basically drawing using pixels. We drew a simple picture then labeled every colour with a letter and wrote out line by line how many of each colour there is. This took quite a while! After that, we tried to draw eachother's picture using their 'codeâ€™.

I learnt about how some pictures are made and that detailed pictures take up lots of storage. It was very interesting and satisfying when the picture came out right.
