**-Taking a Vacation-****			**

**Target****~To reach 35%~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective**

*I learnt how to use many functions in one piece of coding to work out the cost of a vacation. I learnt that when you are stuck, you should keep going even if you think you're never going to reach your target. The longer you spend doing a task, the more you will take out of it.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*My learning was limited by when it said that 'return' was an outside function but I wasn’t sure what that meant. It meant that it wasn’t inside the function - simply that it really was outside a function.*

*Also, as always, I was limited by myself. *

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time I will do research earlier. If I had known what the error message meant, I could have resolved it earlier, rather than trying to get rid of the return piece of code.*
