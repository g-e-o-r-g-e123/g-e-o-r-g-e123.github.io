In today's lesson I was finishing what I had started for homework on my quiz, I was doing the maths. The hardest part was thinking of a way to do it.I decided on using greater than symbols. I would put variables against each other and the one with the greatest value would come up. 

E.g.

If p>n and p>e and p>i:

	Print("You are popular")

I used this for every variable but if the top two greatest values were the same, it would print 'You are stupid'. I also helped classmates which helped me to believe that I know what I am doing.
