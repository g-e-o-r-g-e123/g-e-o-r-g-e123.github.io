**-Robot arm attempt 1-****			**

**Target****~To make the robot arm move in the ways displayed in the instructions~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*We learnt by copying from the book but I don't think it was copied exactly right. We asked what other groups had done and it looked different to ours. After we found out it didn’t work properly, we decided to start again because it was put in the wrong order.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*We could have concentrated harder on what we thought was wrong with the code rather than what other people thought was wrong with it. We also could have read the code properly rather than in the wrong order. If we had done both of these, the productivity in the lesson would increase and success rate would increase.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time we will concentrate more on what the booklet says rather than what we think it says or what other people think it says. Also don't get distracted by *brrr… click click click… brr… brrrrr**
