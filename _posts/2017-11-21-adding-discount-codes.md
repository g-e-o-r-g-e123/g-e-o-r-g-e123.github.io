Today, I tried to add discount codes to my spreadsheet. I used vlookup on the separate sheet called 'discountcodes' which had a list of random discount codes with a range of discount percentages. It was quite simple to do but I tried to make my sheet look nice by having not many elements to it. I put lots of code into one grand total cell to make it look clean. It took me the whole lesson to do this because I was trying to figure out why it would not work. It turned out it was because I forgot to put *.
