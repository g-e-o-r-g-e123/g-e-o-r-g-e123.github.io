Turtle is the way to draw in python. You can draw in different colours and also fill. If you want you could change the speed of the drawing and also show a turtle. You have to be very precise. In the lesson we learned how to use it, the basics and also for homework, I researched commands in turtle and made a rainbow. I did this by drawing circles from the same point but made them bigger every time and changed the colour after a certain number of circles were drawn. Then i drew a white rectangle to cover the bottom part of the circle. This was quite an interesting task and also satisfying.
