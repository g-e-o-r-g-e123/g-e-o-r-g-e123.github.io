In today's lesson, we carried on with encryption on google sheets. To encrypt a message, you use 'vlookupâ€™. That means, v-vertical then lookup. So vertical lookup. I managed to do this but struggled to decrypt the message without creating a whole new list.

You could use this skill to encrypt messages to your bank or important details you would not want anyone bad to use. Overall this lesson was not too challenging, so a good start to the year.
