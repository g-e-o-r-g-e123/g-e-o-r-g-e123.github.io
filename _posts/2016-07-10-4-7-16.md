In class last lesson we learnt about internet safety and about our news articles, about sexting and revenge porn. This was interesting to find out what other people found out. The main thing we learnt was that not just that sexting is illegal if you are under age, it can also ruin any sort of social life. If you get caught sexting you get a criminal record, this means that if you try to get a job in the future, your chances are smaller.

We also got our Microbits, this was good because now we can test our code out for real rather than on a simulator. I just need to do a little bit more coding on my game and then it will be finished.
