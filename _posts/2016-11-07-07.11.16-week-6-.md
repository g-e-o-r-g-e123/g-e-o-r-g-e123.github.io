    <td>We, step by step, followed the instructions to guide us through the process of making these codes. These made sense and when we tested them, most of the time, they worked like we wanted them to. I understood what this code was doing, it was mostly do x if y is true, if y is false then do z.</td>

    <td>I think a few miscommunications stopped the lesson from running so smoothly, apart from that then I think Ben and I worked well this lesson.</td>
