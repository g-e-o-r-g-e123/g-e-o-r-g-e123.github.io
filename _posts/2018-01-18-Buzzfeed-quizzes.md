Today, we went on to buzzfeed and took some random quizzes. They were like 'pick some pasta and we will say which state you should live in'. After this, we created a document and planned out a quiz of our own.

Today I learned about the process of a quiz like this, you have to create questions and the answers mean something like more Hawaiian or add 5 mental Age. There is actually lots of thought put into it even though the quizzes are ridiculous.
