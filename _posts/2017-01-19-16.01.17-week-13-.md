**-Discovering codecademy-****			**

**Target****~To get quite far through the codecademy ~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*To learn I read the description and saw the examples of how to code a certain thing. Then I did as the instructions said to do, for example, #coding is cool. Then tried to memorise these for the end where it tested you.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*I think that the fact that it was all typing and no talking to Mr Keen as a class in between parts. Also I think that i could have gone quicker because my computer wasn't working at the beginning so i had to switch and I didnâ€™t work very quickly because i am quite slow at reading.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*If we ever do codecademy again, I will read through the information more than once and try to memorise it thoroughly. I will also try to work through problems for longer than 5 minutes then ask for help because I think last time I may have asked for help a bit early a few times because it was all new to me.*
