The lesson was quite fun but it was a lot of explaining throughout about what media is. We played media bingo which is: you had a bingo card of questions about computers and phones. You then go around the class asking them until you get a yes, then you type their name on the question. Then you move on to a different question and you can not ask them again. We also did a lot on social media including safety, uses and when you should start using them.
