**-Embedding-****			**

**Target****~To learn how to manually edit blogs and get to around 35% on codecademy~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective**

**_We all learnt by Mr Keen showing us the coding in his blog and the outcome (his posts). He explained the difference between TH (table headings) and TD (table division). We were also shown how to embed a video rather than just add the link in. Which I will now demonstrate (hopefully)_**

**_After this we did some more codecademy as per usual._**

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*I didn't learn as much codecademy as usual due to Mr Keen’s  **very** useful talk.  I completed a few more stages of codecademy, but had found some of them difficult which is not usnusual. However I did manage to get those done, which was pleasing.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*This week I haven't found any new way to work. I will just keep working in the same way and hopefully I will slowly but surely make my way through the process. Yes, I do know my strategies aren’t perfect but they never can be.*
