In today's lesson, we started on our quizzes. The majority of the lesson was theory and not practice but we all needed it. I knew how to use; Loops, functions and ifâ€™s, all i had to do was put them together and create a quiz. I think I have made significant progress on learning the skills and also getting to the end goal of having a functional quiz. I am in the process of asking the questions, after, I will write some code to make these answers mean something and have an end result.
