Last lesson we created plans for our microbit games. Mine will be rock, paper, scissors. If you press 'A' it is ‘rock’, if you press ‘B’ it is ‘paper’ and ‘A’ +’B’ is ‘scissors’. The microbit will randomly choose ‘R’ ‘P’ or ‘S’. If you win, you get one point and if you lose the microbit gets a point.
