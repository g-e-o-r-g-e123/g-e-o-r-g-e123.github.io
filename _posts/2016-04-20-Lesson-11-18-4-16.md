Today we looked through a few people's prezzis. Everyone had done a prezi and handed it in but not everyone had handed it in correctly. Then we reviewed 2 of them and we learned not to zoom in and out too much and to put relevant information rather than a whole biography and nothing about thow they contributed towards the creation of modern computers and technology. After looking through other peopleâ€™s prezzis I think I may need to make a few changes.
