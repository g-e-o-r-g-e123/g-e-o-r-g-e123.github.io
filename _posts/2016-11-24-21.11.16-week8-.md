**>****More blog changing and a bit of robot arm****>****	**

**Target****>****_To update my blog design and start the coding on the robot arm_****<**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*I used my resources and helped myself using mr Keen's blog to see what was different and edited mine to look how i wanted it to look. Then Ben and I started coding with the robot arm but we realised we did not need the robot arm to check if it worked because it was to reset the arm. We did this by watching the screen whilst looking at the book, reading it out to the other person so I could read at a reasonable speed for him to type.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*With my blog I could have figured out to use Mr Keen's blog earlier. Apart from that it went quite well.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time I will help my partner more when he is stuck so we can progress to the next task because last time I was just trying to fix mine to make it look better.*
