    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I am new to the FUZE coding format.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To further my understanding of FUZE.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I coded a few programmes out of the book.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My partner and I read from the book and coded what it said we needed to, for a bit I read out to my partner and he did the coding then at parts it swapped. This worked well as we finished a few tasks and they all worked correctly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think it would have been better if we set up the computer and monitor quicker as we forgot to plug in one key part, this cut out part of our learning time, meaning less coding and less reading.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will check every cable if the monitor is not displaying what it should be so I can get going quicker. I should get better at accuracy when I type so it does not break the code.</td>
