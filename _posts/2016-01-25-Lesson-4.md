Today was a good day. We put pieces of paper on a table, each with an action written on them and the writing is all to do with social media, we put them in the order of safety, our safest thing to do was to send a funny picture of your cat and the most dangerous was telling people that you are going to a party and noting when and where you will be at the party. We also wrote on the board the advantages of social media and the disadvantages of social media. LUCKILY no one got annoying so it was mostly fun and enjoyable (or as enjoyable as school can be).
