**-More Codecademy-****			**

**Target****~To reach 30%~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective**

**_This lesson was all about getting through the next few stages of Codecademy. I'm getting better at knowing how the format of the exercises work. I"m getting used to it, into it and understanding how to do them. _**

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*My learning was limited by my natural speed and figuring some things out. I did work by myself more and I also helped others which took some of my time. *

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time I will just keep going and try to go quicker. Helping others helped my learning, because if I can explain it to someone else, I know I have learnt it.*
