    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have coded using FUZE for a few weeks so far.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create a game where you have to guess a random number from 1-100</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Nearly, it did not work properly again, it came up with an error message.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We did the Same thing as last week, working by reading out what the book says and the other person following, as that was a success but clearly it did not work out. We changed it up a bit though by having the book to read from when typing so less verbal mistakes were made.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to be able to understand the code so instead of partly blankly reading it, we find out where we make mistakes easier. This speeds up the process so we complete more work in the lesson. This will improve my learning well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will  try to read deeper into the explanation so it will work as I said before. Also I will try to type quicker and more accurately, this also speeds up the checking and typing process. Also, again I need to speak clearly and louder. </td>
