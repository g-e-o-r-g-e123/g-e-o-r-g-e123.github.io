**-The Coding is Getting Harder-****			**

**Target****~To Finish More Tasks~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*This time I read through the descriptions in more detail, and more times, so that I would further my understanding of how to code that code. This was very effective because it made me think more about the challenge.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*My brain limited my learning! I was stuck for a few minutes because I made a simple spelling mistake that I couldn't spot. I even used the hints, which obviously didn’t help because they didn’t know it was a spelling mistake. Eventually after reading through it letter for letter I saw I had written 'sting’ instead of string. Also, I could have used the www to help me figure out my problems.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

* Next time, I will use my resources better. And I have learnt to always check spellings if I can't see anything else that is wrong.*
