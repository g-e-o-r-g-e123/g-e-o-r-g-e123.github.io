In today's lesson we had to create a virtual shop which could display items and their unit prices. Then it would have to have a place to select an item, quantity and display the subtotal. Then this subtotal had to be added to all other subtotals to form the total price. We did this by using '=vlookup()’ to look through the list and find the unit prices. Then I * this by the quantity to form the subtotal. Then I used ‘= sum’ to form the total.
