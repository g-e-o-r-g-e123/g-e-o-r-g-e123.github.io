**-giving up-****			**

**Target****~to learn how to learn~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*I learnt by taking in what Mr Keen was saying from my memory rather than taking notes. I also learnt from watching a video because it taught me why not to give up and why teachers may seem harsh when they are just trying to get you to the successful part. There were many parts to this lesson including how to learn, for example don't give up, don’t be afraid to say 'I don’t know’ and don’t laugh at people when they aren’t doing what is expect of them. Instead, encourage them to succeed.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*My learning was slightly limited when half the class went to drama and we waited for them but there really was nothing i could do about that. I think my learning was limited by my, not so amazing, memory.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time when we have a lesson like this i might take notes in my planner so i can remember after the lesson*
