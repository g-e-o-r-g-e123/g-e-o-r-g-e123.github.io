Today was a good lesson, we logged on and Mr Keen looked at our homework (my last blog post) to check we had done it right. Next we watched a video about prezi and its uses, basically an advert. Then we created our own prezi accounts, we looked at some of Mr Keen's prezis, they were really good and the turns and unexpected zooming really far in looked cool. Finally we got to create our own prezis and we finished them for homework. Pretty much one of the best lessons we have had so far.
