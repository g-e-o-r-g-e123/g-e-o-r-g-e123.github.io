(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I tried out one thing, then checked to make sure it didn't get worse, then improved until it fixed and then (finally) I fixed it. It seemed to be an error in my font and text. This meant that I had to change some edits that I previously added in.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I did not know what was the problem with my blog was and when github said which line the error was on, it was a few lines off so got a bit confusing. I could work on working more logically to find out what the problem was with my coding, a bit like a robot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If my blog breaks again , I need to work from my last change backwards. All together I think I persevered quite well but I probably could have worked more efficiently.</td>
