Today we switched from Mr Tansley to Mr Keen. Instead of carrying on spreadsheets, we are now coding on repl.it. This is like codecademy but it is free to code anything you want. At first we went back through what we had done to get back into what you need to know to code some simple things. We coded a simple AI which will ask you questions and have a few simple responses after you answer

We do this by using x=input() and print(). 

I am happy with what I did last lesson and I will carry on with it as homework
