In our last lesson we looked at how everyone (most people) did their homework. Our homework was about how social media can affect our goals and aspirations. This was useful because it showed us everyone else's point of view (and how good their grammar is). Next we split into groups of three and created a list of 10 ways to use social media effectively,  for example: keep in mind that anyone is anyone, only say what you would say to someoneâ€™s face and be specific to prevent misunderstanding. It was quite interesting because i was the only one with social media. Then we watched two videos, the first one was about a girl without a phone. Everyone else was on their phone 24/7, accidentally blocking her out. The second video was an annoying song all about how people overuse Twitter. Everyone was using twitter apart from one of them and by the end everyone was using twitter. Finally we discussed what both videos meant. The songs were both about overusing social media.
