**-Blog Assessment-****			**

**Target****~To review my friend's blog~**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*This wasn't much of a learning lesson but it was a reviewing lesson. I found it useful because I got to see what some other people’s blogs looked like, what people thought of mine and what I could improve.*

*From looking at other people's blogs I found out that mine is good enough in style, apart from I could have made the colour scheme better because you couldn’t really read the text.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*My learning was limited because we didn't really have many opportunities to learn. But this wasn’t me limiting my learning so I don’t have to work on it!*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*So next time I edit my blog I will change the colour of the text, and maybe my avatar. After Christmas I will edit my background to something relative to the New Year.*

*Also I will try and more content to my blogs.*
