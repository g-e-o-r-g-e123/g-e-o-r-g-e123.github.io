Today we learnt about while loops. These are useful if you want an action repeated but only a certain number of times or WHILE something is True. These are created similarly to if functions, e.g.  	  while Time  < 12

			  print(Time)

This will LOOP the 'print(Time)' as long as Time is less than twelve. This could be useful in a timer or an AI. We worked on a worksheet about this. This worksheet is about starting with 1p and then you get 2p the next month and it doubles every time. 

pocketMoney = 0.01

totalMoney = 0

for week in range(6):

    print("\nIt is week",week)

    print("You will get £",pocketMoney)

    pocketMoney = 2*pocketMoney

    totalMoney= totalMoney + pocketMoney

print("\nYou have £",totalMoney,"!!!!!!")

print("Can I have some?")

input("\nPress ENTER to exit program")
