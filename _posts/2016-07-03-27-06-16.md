In our last lesson we looked at what revenge porn and sexting is. This was an alright lesson because we did not have to do any work. I learnt that I should never send bad pictures or messages to anyone because if they got forwarded or put on the internet everyone would think I was a disgrace. Also it is illegal, I would not send anyone / post pictures or messages that anyone sent to me, because that is bullying.
