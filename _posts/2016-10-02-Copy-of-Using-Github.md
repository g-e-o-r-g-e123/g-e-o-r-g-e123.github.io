    <td>I read faster than last lesson, this was good because it meant we could complete the work quicker. I think that the step by step approach was a good idea as we tested to see if it worked. This meant we could see what it all meant and understand it more easily than all at once.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I still think I could read quicker than before. I also now think that typing speed and not so good communication between us  held us back slightly. We could communicate better by saying what the typer had to type. Also I am not so quick at typing when told what to type, for example being told that I was meant to type PRINT, i might make it slower than if i thought to do it then did it alone.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure I talk quick enough and not too quick so that he can type easily. I need to concentrate harder when typing to speed up the process and get more work done quickly.  All around, I think that I have done reasonably well in the lessons.</td>
