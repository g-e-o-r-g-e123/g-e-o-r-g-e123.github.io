Wednesday: I was very pleased when I reached 100 exercises I ended on 38% which was quite good. I have learnt about lists. I got stuck on one but got through it after.

Friday: In my ten minutes, I managed to learn about dictionaries and how they pair two pieces of information like a dictionary. I also learnt how to sort lists and dictionaries. This wasn't too hard because all I got stuck on was a spelling error, not too clever.

Sunday: I finished this section on 42% which i am happy with because it took quite a while to get off 38%. I was given quite a lot of information and had to use the help of google to search a few things up. This was tricky but I think I managed to take some stuff away from it.
