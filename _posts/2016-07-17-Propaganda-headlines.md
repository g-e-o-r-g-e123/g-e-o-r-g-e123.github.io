**How the £600million free school meals scheme is 'just making pupils fat' and is failing to significantly boost their grades -Daily Mail- 16th July 2016**

*From this i would think that the Government is paying £600 million on schools meals and is not boosting grades.*

*Actually, it is only for two years that they receive these meals. The rate of rising obesity is only by about 1%. But SATs results are in fact increasing by a more significant figure. So this headline is misleading.*

# **Jeremy Corbyn's supporters are like Lenin style bully boys who'd send women to the gulag -Mirror- 16th July 2016**

*From this headline, I would think that ALL Corbyn supporters are going to kill and send ALL Women to death camps.*

*Actually, a few Female MPs have been threatened by few supporters. Bad but not as bad as what the headline suggests. *

**PM set to back wave of new grammar schools -Sunday Express- 17th July 2016**

*	From this headline, I would think that Theresa May has agreed to build many new grammar schools.*

*	Actually, the PM has not agreed to anything like this, people are just hoping this will happen.*
