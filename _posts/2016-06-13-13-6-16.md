Last lesson, we started to create/code our microbit games. We could either work in pairs or on our own. I found it sort of hard to code, I still have quite a lot to do to finish. Part of the lesson, i spent thinking about how to start coding the game and planning it.

	Also in the lesson Mr. Keen told us about types of people who can work on their own, but some people have to work with help. I would say I can work on my own but sometimes I work in groups well.
