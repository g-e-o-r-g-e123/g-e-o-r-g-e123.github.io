**Target	****>****_To get my blog working again _****<**

**LESSON REVIEW**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

*I decided that I couldn't find the problem so I copied and pasted the original code, basic black and white blog, and then tried changing it from there. This worked but I did not change much, because I didnâ€™t want to break it. I learnt that sometimes what you want is not always easy to get.*

**What limited my learning? Which habits do i need to work on?**

*I think I need to learn more about which parts of the code do what and instead of looking for the word (for example), background and changing what is next to it. I should be more confident with editing rather than be slow.*

**What will I change next time? How will I improve my learning?**

*Next time I will probably take more risks but still keep checking to see if it works out, I will keep trying to add a picture as a background as that is my main goal.*
