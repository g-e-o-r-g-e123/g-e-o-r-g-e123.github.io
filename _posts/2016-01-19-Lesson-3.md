Today was a good day but also a bad day. We played an almost game which was one side of the class was disagree, one agree and the middle can't decide. Mr Keen would read out a statement and then we would move to one side a certain distance depending on how true to that side we were. The statements were like: I get persuaded to want something after watching an advert even if before I did not want it. Then it all went downhill from there as some people, not mentioning any names… were being really annoying so Mr Keen just talked to us about 'reality TV shows’ and fakes in adverts. We talked about the Mcdonald’s burgers and the ones you see in adverts.
