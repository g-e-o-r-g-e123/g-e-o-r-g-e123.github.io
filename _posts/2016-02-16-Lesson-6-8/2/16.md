Last lesson we created an identity map all about who we are, what we do and  our use of social media. We were shown a few examples by previous years. It was a good lesson generally. We talked about how you act differently in front of other people like friends and teachers. If in front of your friends you want them to think you are nice. In front of teachers you want to be good. It is all about impressions on people and what they think about you.
