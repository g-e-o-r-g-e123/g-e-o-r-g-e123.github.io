Today we learnt about how to concatenate and decrypt fully. I found the decryption part quite simple but found the concatenating difficult because there was lots else being said at the time like how to separate after which i could not understand. I finished the concatenation at home, it was quite simple in the end when I realised my problem was that i could not spell concatenate correctly.
