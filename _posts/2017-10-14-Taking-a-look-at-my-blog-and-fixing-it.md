This lesson we all had to submit our blogs, then I decided I needed to update my own blog as it looked quite boring and unchanged. I changed my wallpaper and avatar. I did this by going into style.scss and _config.yml, and pasted my links in. I am happy that I knew what to do because it showed that I can understand and remember what to change to do this. This is useful because it life, I may need to create or edit a website, if I do then I will need to know how to change details to make it feel well built. I also wrote my last blog.
