At the beginning we were shown the sorting hat scene in Harry Potter. Then we talked about what it did as a more detailed description. 

We learnt how to simply code a BBC micro:bit. This bit was reasonably easy to pick up so I finished quickly. Then we moved on to code the same thing but in javascript. This part was a bit harder but I managed to finish it as homework. If you thought logically it made it easier. This lesson was a pretty good lesson, I enjoyed learning how to code a micro:bit.
